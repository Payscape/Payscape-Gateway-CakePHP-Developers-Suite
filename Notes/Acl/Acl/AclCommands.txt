A console tool for managing the DbAcl

Usage:
cake acl [subcommand] [-h] [-v] [-q]

Subcommands:

create     Create a new ACL node
delete     Deletes the ACL object with the given <node> reference
setparent  Moves the ACL node under a new parent.
getpath    Print out the path to an ACL node.

grant      Grant an ARO permissions to an ACO.
deny       Deny an ARO permissions to an ACO.
inherit    Inherit an ARO's parent permissions.
view       View a tree or a single node's subtree.
initdb     Initialize the DbAcl tables. 
			Uses this command : cake schema create DbAcl
           
cake -app "C:\xampp1.7.2\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" acl view aco controllers/search
we can use the subcommands, but it appears to be quicker to use acl_extras. 
less prone to errors and looks like it takes less time because all of the 
necessary operations are run concurrently.
