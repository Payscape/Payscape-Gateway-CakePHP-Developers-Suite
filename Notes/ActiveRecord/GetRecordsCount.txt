
There is a special count parameter for the find method, but that probably won't fit your needs, as you want to show more than just the counted products.

It's best to define COUNT in the fields parameter of the find method. So:

'fields' => array('Model.field1', 'COUNT(Model.field2) AS products_count')


		$total_properties = $this->Property->find('count', array(
				'conditions' => $conditions,
				'recursive' => 0,
		));

LOADING MODELS

$this->set('firms',$this->Firm->find('all',array('conditions'=>array('Firm.uThis should be simple to understand. If you are using a controller and you need to load another model, you can call:

$this->loadModel('SomeModel');
Then you can make calls to the model like you normally would:

$this->SomeModel->read(null, '1');


App::uses is for lazy loading of classes. So you can still load a model using uses:

App::uses('MyModel', 'Model');
But then you will need to call it differently:

$my_model = new MyModel();
$my_model->read(null, '1');ser_id'=>'5'))));
