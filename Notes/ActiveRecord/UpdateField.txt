   
   Two ways to update an indevidual field:
  	1 
   	$this->Model->id=$id;
    $this->Model->saveField("fieldName","value");
    
$this->User->id=$user_id;
$this->User->saveField("fb_image", $fb_image);

	2
 $this->Model->updateAll(array("fieldName"=>"value"),array("fieldName"=>"condition"))

n second example, first array will update the value in defined field 
and second array defines the "WHERE" condition

	3 
	// Update field to desired value
$data = array( 'someModel' => array( 'id' => $this->someModel->id, 'someField' => 'someInfo' ) );

// Save the changes
$this->someModel->save( $data, false, array('someField') ); 

	4
$this->Post->id = 1;
$this->Post->read();
$this->Post->set('title', 'New title for the article');
$this->Post->save();

How to update a single field in CakePHP
Here's a quick line of code to demonstrate how to update a 
single field in CakePHP.

Suppose we will be updating a field named 'confirmed' in a 
model called 'User' with the id of 5. We will then have an 
array with just that value, like this:


	$data = array(
	           'User' => array(
	                        'id'          =>    5,
	                        'confirmed'   =>    1
	           )
	        );
	

We should then pass it on to a save function:

		$this->User->save( $data, false, array('confirmed') );


You can RTFM about the save() function here.
