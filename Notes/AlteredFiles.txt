
create a folder Updates in TriuNaturals/vacationfish.localdomain

This way you can upload from there quickly and be sure you have all the files 
you need going to the correct folders in one simple upload when it comes time 
to update the Production server. 

You could make this set of files available in the 
vacationfish FTP account as well, 
then if Jason wishes to do so he'll have everything in 
one neat package.
