you can do

                echo $this->Html->link('go back',"javascript:history.back()");


i think its much better to add

        $this->set('referer',$this->referer());

to your beforeRender();

and

$this->Html->link('back',$referer);

to  your view.

one less reliance on js is a win in my book.
