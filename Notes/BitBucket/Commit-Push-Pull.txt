First we do a Pull / Fetch
to check the status of our remote repo.

Then we do a Commit...
Then we do a Push.

So far we can use the repo from 
our local repo within Eclipse. 

we copied the files from the payscape-wrappers local repo
into payscape.localdomain, added the Cake core files
and the little site fired up fine, once we have the correct 
CakePHP libraries installed, and the database set up. 

To date have not figured out how to use an Eclipse project as a local 
repository so that work can be concluded in the repo, 
then pushed to the remote repo.
