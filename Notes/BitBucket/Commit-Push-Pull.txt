First we do a Pull / Fetch
to check the status of our remote repo.

Then we do a Commit...
Then we do a Push.

It's looking like we can Push directly
from payscape.localdomain to our 
remote repo. 


Window / Open Perspective / Other / Git Repository Exploriing

we can use the Git Repositories view to Push directly to our remote directory. 
In the Git Repositories view, 
click on the target repo
e.g. payscape-wrappers
Right click 
Push to Upstream
Enter the password

Now let's check.
