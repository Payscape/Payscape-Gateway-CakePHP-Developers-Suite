
put this in the Controller just before the query that 
throws the error

	$this->Search->query('SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1');
	
	does the trick on BlueHost. 


We also tried to use this fix from Gawgle but it dit not work. Also cleared the cache in the tmp directory without any luck.

Finally we struck gold by inseting 

$this->TheProblemModelName->query("SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS =1"); 

in the AppController's beforeFilter()

In this instance it was the Node model that we had to set.

Hope this helps someone in the future.
