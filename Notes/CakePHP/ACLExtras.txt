To set this up and actually use it, do this:

Put AclExtras right into 

cake2.2.2/lib/Cake/Console/Command

now use Xampp shell to navigate to Console

enter "cake"

You'll see all of the plugins you have available displayed. 
What we did not know was that the plugin AclExtras 
is called by acl_extras.

could be that's because we aren't really running it as a plugin, 
but instead as a part of the Core Files. 

Woo Hoo. 
Took about 3 hours to figure this out. 


Now to see if we can actually get this to work: 

More notes are at fishbake.localdomain

acl_extras -h does the trick for bringing up the help 
files, now we'll print them. 

we have this working in fishbake.localdomain now
.
