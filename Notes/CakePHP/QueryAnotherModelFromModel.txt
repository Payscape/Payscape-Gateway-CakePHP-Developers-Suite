How can i call, from a Model, a function present in another model? I would like not to repeat code.


	We can use Model relation to call the function in another model. Eg.

	$this->Model->ModelOne->find();
	$this->Model->ModelOne->customFunc();
	If there is no relation in the models, The we can use

	$this->loadModel('ModelName');
	To use in the model. In this case you can use

	$this->ModelName->function();
	directly as you've loaded that model.

	Not sure using 'loadModel' is correct as of Cake 1.3, per The loadModel function comes handy when you need to use a model 		which is not the controller's default model or its associated model.. To load a Model from a Model use ClassRegistry::init – Aaron 

You should try to have relationships between your models. There are many types of relationships which you can read here...

If you have above said associations, you can access your associated models using:

$this->Model->OtherModel->function();
If your models are not related in any way, you should use:

ClassRegistry::init('OtherModel')->function();
You can check out my question on this where I obtained great answers

if there's a (direct or indirect) relationship between the model, you can call the function: $this->Model1->Model2->...->Modeln->function();

use bindModel


	no, you should use ClassRegistry like so:
	    //MessagesController - in my send() method...

	$this->set('content', ClassRegistry::init('Content')->find('first', array(
        	'conditions' => array('Content.id' => 3)
	  )));

NOTE:this is from my controller but I am pretty sure it works in model too.
