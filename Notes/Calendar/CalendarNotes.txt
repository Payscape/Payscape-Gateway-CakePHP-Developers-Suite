
1 the calculate function is goofing up when we are 
trying to set availability for a property. 

see the jQueryDev section in VFishDev for info on 
how to pass the property_id to the jQuery script 
in calendar_hover.js

2 we need to click start date, end date and have it 
send a jQuery post to the db to complete a reservation 
start_date, end_date. 

we need some kind of button to trigger this, we don't want
to be creating reservations just on "clickorino". 

3 the calculate costs function on the user side appears 
to be doing its job. 


4 we need to isoloate the pricing functions so that 
user clicks on tabs. the pricing form errors out 
if we do not 
4.1 create base price
4.2 create high season price
4.3 we want ways to create other high season prices. (dates)
4.4 shouldn't we be able to create as many of these as we want?
4.5 to do so, we want a table that has only about 4 or 5 fields 
in it, all of them numbers/dates. 

see book tennis to get ideas.
