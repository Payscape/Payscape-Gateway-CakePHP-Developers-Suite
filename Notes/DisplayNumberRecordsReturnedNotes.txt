
for one thing, we encode the results we get from 
    search_count
    
    echo json_encode($this->request->params['form']['file']);
    
    then we should be able to look into the page source 
    and see what has been returned. 
    
    on the other hand, json_encode is not being used 
    in the search results that generate the listings. 
    
    echo json_encode($this->request->params['form']['file']);
