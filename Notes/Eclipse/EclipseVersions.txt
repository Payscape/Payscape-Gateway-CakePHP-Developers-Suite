We have three projects in /xampp-vfish-git/htdocs

1 vfishgit.localdomain
	this was a copy of the vacationfish.localdomain, 
	with the /app folder from the landofmoab Git bitbucket repo
2 vacationfish
	the local Git repo for VFish was imported into this project
	then these two projects were synched, so that now we may use 
	the vfishgit.localdomain to preview changes in /app, 
	then copy them into vacationfish, 
	then commit directly from there. 
	
	use project > compare with each other to determine files that need to be 
	copied Eclipse directory compare makes locating the file differences easy, 
	and we can copy right > left and visa versa. 
	
	
3 vacationfish.localdomain
	our local dev environment where new stuff is created. 
	as new features are developed, we can test in vfishgit.localdomain
	then copy to vacationfish repo, 
	then commit
	
	this does create another step, but we keep the vfishgit.localdomain
	as as near a copy of VFish as possible.
