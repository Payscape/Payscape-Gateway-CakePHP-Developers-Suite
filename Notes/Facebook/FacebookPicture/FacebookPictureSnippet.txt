	One other point. 
	Using "Log in with FAcebook" in takes us to the home page, 
	we want it to take us to our Profile or Listings page. 
	
	
	
	
	Here is how we can display the Facebook pic in the 
	Edit Profile page. 

	Then we can give the user the option

	"Use my Facebook Picture"
	
	in which case we want to 
	1 remove the image from User['fb_image'] // set this to ""
	2 delete the image from User. 
	in this case naming that picture the same for everyone is a good thing. 
	as subsequent images are uploaded, they will overwrite the previous one, 
	so that we do not have to delete. 
	
	
	currently this is the entry in users.fb_image that indicates that a  file 
	has been uploaded for the user's profile pic. 
	
	image/jpeg
	
	let's try something:
	
	http://localhost:8092/vacationfish.localdomain/public_html/
	
	http://triubendev.com/dev/vfish3
	
	
	
	
		
	<div class="profile-picture">
	<?php
			if ( ! empty($user_info['User']['fb_image'])) {
						echo $this->Html->image($user_info['User']['fb_image']['profile'], array('width' => 209, 'height' => 209));
		
				}
				elseif ( ! empty($user_info['User']['facebook_id'])) {
					echo $this->Facebook->picture($user_info['User']['facebook_id'], array('facebook-logo' => 0, 'size' => 'normal'));
				}
				else {
					echo $this->Html->image('no_user.jpg', array('width' => 209, 'height' => 209));
				}
?>
	
	</div>
		// here we'll need a function that can use a post link
		// to update User.fb_picture to ""
	< link > Use my Facebook Picture < />
	
	This can all be accomplished with a button. 
	
	function reset_fb_image() {
	$this->User::model()->query("UPDATE users SET fb_image = '' WHERE id = $user_id");
		if(file_exists($fb_image_file)){
				unlink($fb_image_file);
		}
