Node and parent arguments can be in one of the following formats:

 - <model>.<id> - The node will be bound to a specific record of the
given model.

 - <alias> - The node will be given a string alias (or path, in the
case of <parent>)
   i.e. 'John'.  When used with <parent>, this takes the form of an
alias path,
   i.e. <group>/<subgroup>/<parent>.

To add a node at the root level, enter 'root' or '/' as the <parent>
parameter.
