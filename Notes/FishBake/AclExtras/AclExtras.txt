We put AclExtras shell in 
    cake2.2.2/libs/Cake/Console/Command
    this fired up the Help functions. 
    
    when we go to the Console and run 
    "cake" we get to see the paths and shells that are loaded. 
    
    next we used 
    
    cake -app "C:\xampp\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" acl_extras aco_sync
    
    Cake tells us that the database config file is missing, 
    and that Cake wants to see an AppModel file in the Cake\Models folder. 
    
    so we added the load Plugin directive in the app/Config/bootstrap file
    put the database file in there, and we have the plugin in app/Plugin
    
    let's see what happens.

let's create a bootstrap for our Console. 
Then add this to it.

CakePlugin::load('AclExtras');

./Console/cake AclExtras.AclExtras -h
./Console/cake AclExtras.AclExtras aco_sync -h

is cake a command or an address here?

C:\>cake -app "C:\xampp\htdocs\Nublet\app" AclExtras.AclExtras aco_sync
