 cake -app "C:\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" acl_extras aco_sync
 
 
 That was because we did not have our Controllers in place. 
 
 
  cake -app "C:\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" acl_extras aco_sync
  
  cake -app "C:\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" acl_extras aco_update
  
 we now have the updated version of AclExtras in place. 
 the older version was from 2011. 
 
 
   cake -app "C:\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" acl_extras aco_update
