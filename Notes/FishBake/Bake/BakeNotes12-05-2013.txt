/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/payscape.localdomain/app/

./cake -app /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/payscape.localdomain/app/ bake model all

looks like we want to use 127.0.0.1 rather than localhost

using 
./cake -app /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/payscape.localdomain/app/ bake model all
bakes all the Models,
for fields where you want Validation created, make sure the fields are not set to NULL yes

now to create our controllers

./cake -app /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/payscape.localdomain/app/ bake controller all



./cake -app /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/payscape.localdomain/app/ bake view all
