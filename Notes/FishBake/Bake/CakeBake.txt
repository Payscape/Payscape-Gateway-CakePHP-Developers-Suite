The problem was entirely due to using Windows Command Prompt, 
or Aptana Terminal Command Line 

For Xampp installs we use Xampp's Shell in the Xampp Control Panel. 
Also upgraded PEAR and installed PHPUnit. 

There are required classes that have to be in the Console/
Model, View, Controller, 
and 
Console/Command these are in RequiredClasses ForTheBakeApp.txt

there was one addition that we put in Console/Config/core.php 
to clear up an error message. 

This got things working. 

Remember, to use the Console to Bake, 
create the folders right in the Console where your Baked stuff will go. 
This eliminates path and app problems, plus we can then use exactly we want 
and do not overwrite existing files. 





Cake bake is screwed up. problems with PHP etc. 
hard telling what's causing this, we are abandoning Cake Bake for now. 




Command prompt
Go to Console 

cd C:\xampp-vfish-git\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\lib\Cake\Console

cake -app "C:\xampp-vfish-git\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" bake model UserImages

cake bake
This starts the bake app. 

we are going to be using two models
user_images 
	id
	user_id
	image
	name
	sort

user_properties_images
	user_images_id
	property_id
	
	ok, we copied a fresh install of Cake. 
	now to specify our app path
	
	--app ../app cake bake model PropertyImages
