AppController, AppHelper, AppModel and AppShell¶
These classes are now required to be part of the app directory, as they were removed from the CakePHP core. If you do not already have these classes, you can use the following while upgrading:

// app/View/Helper/AppHelper.php
App::uses('Helper', 'View');
class AppHelper extends Helper {
}

// app/Model/AppModel.php
App::uses('Model', 'Model');
class AppModel extends Model {
}

// app/Controller/AppController.php
App::uses('Controller', 'Controller');
class AppController extends Controller {
}

// app/Console/Command/AppShell.php
App::uses('Shell', 'Console');
class AppShell extends Shell {
}
