
Today we are firing up the Cake Console to see if things
have gotten better with Bake. 

We will do Model, View and Controller for 
Wishlist, WishlistItems and Properties.

let's see how this goes, these are the three that are 
giving us problems, and it could be Bake will solve them. 

First we'll print Bake Help notes. 

turns out the /cake folder has Cake 1.3.4 in there. 
where did that come from?

Fortunately index.php in the root is configured to use the Cake2.2.2 libs

is the /cake folder even used? 
we don't think so. 

OK, now to see if we can fire up Console Help first.
