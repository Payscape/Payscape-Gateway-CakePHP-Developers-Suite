BEDROOMS NOT BEDS - " When creating a listing, 
it gives the option to specify the number of beds. 
This is a typo, it should be ""bedrooms"" not beds. "

The facebook popup on the find rental results page needs to 
be reformatted.
 Please see the link below for instruction.
 
 If I'm not logged in as a user and click list rentals from the 
 navigation header, i get the following error message: 
 "An Internal Error Has Occurred. Error: 
 An Internal Error Has Occurred."
