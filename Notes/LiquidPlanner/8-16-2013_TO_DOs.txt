0.1	TASK Remove redirect after images upload
0.2	TASK after log in everybody ends up on the home page. 
		we need them to land on /dashboard
	"The login page is the Users dashboard. So can we get the redirect to go to the dashboard when logging in with facebook"

1,1 Delete Properties does not delete images
1 Optimize Search Results page - loads slowly with all of the features enabled
2 Optimize Projects Create - loads slowly
3 My Listings Page Pagination - provide drop down for user to select the number of listings to display per page, a current request from Brandon

Completed:
4 Optimize My LIstings page - loads slowly
    this page was loading as slowly as the Projects Create page is currently. Optimized the queries in the page and now it's behaving properly
    you may assign me this task and we will be able to immediately complete it.

Currently assigned:
5 Facebook profile picture
    we can have this completed quickly as it is part of the Facebook API
    it would seem that if the team is wanting the ability to create 20 profile pictures, that would best be served in a future version of VFish

OK
6 Create Property redirects to the wrong page after creation to add photos
    pretty sure this will be cured when that batch of files is uploaded to VFish that were completed at the same time as the File Upload Suite
    will check on this today and see what's up. pretty sure something from TriuBenDev did not make it to VFish, as this was fixed previously.
