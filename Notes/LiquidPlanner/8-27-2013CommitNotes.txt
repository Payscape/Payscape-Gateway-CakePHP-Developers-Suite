update users table on dev

if there is going to be a time gap 
between commits to dev and commits to live, 
may be better to run the update 
just prior to that commit so that we 
catch as many users as possible, 
although we could certainly run 
the update again, choosing 
WHERE id > $last_user_id

[no, we would want to run the whole thing again
existing users may have changed their profile 
images]

run Fishbake on Vacationfish.localdomain

db edits: 
	change properties.baths to int(4, 1) 
	so that it can hold 1 decimal point.
	
	add user_images table
	
	Acl tables 
		aco
		acl
		acl_aco
		groups
		
	this is how we update our users table:
		
		
	UPDATE users
		INNER JOIN user_images
		ON users.id = user_images.user_id
	SET users.fb_image = user_images.image	
	
	
	update users tables with the profile images data
	once we have user_images table uploaded, we can 
	
	INSERT INTO users (fb_image)  
	SELECT image AS fb_image FROM user_images 
	WHERE user_images.user_id = users.id
	
	we can set up two test tables in Fishbake for testing. 
	should work fine without disrupting.
