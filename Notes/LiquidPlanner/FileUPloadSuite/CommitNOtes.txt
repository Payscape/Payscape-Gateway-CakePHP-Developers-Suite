	---------
	Remove background color on the text input div
	Relocate the Save button below the main image
	
	Note: relocating the submit button below the thumnails 
		was not practical. Each image has its own submit button.
	
	Move the text input onto the picture

	Display only the "Delete" button on the Sort widget, 
	and the "Sort" button on the Delete widget. 
	These widgets were created to keep the Edit interface 
	as simple as possible.

	New layout. 
	
	Tooltip Popup for the notes about the Main Image
