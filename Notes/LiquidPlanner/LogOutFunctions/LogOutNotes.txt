this is the form field that posts the value to set this 
to true
data[User][auto_login] value="1"

FACEBOOK SESSIONS CAN BE A PROBLEM
-----------------------------------

This was to fix problem with 
the same auto_login where COOKIES were disappearing. 


	

Open Facebook.php file in Facebook plugin files.

On line 4 or 5, under __construct, comment out the line which says session_start();

Ideally, CakePHP loads all the plugins which results in PHPSESSID getting set. Comment this out and even Facebook will effectively work.

Also, make sure that you create a folder called 'sessions' under your tmp folder and mark it chmod -R 0777 sessions/ , refresh your application.
