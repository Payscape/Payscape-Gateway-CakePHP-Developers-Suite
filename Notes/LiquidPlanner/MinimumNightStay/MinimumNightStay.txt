We need to add a field for users to enter a minimum nights stay 
duration while creating a listing. 
This should be in the pricing section under "Weekend Per Night" rate. 
On the vacationers view of the listing page, we also need to display the minimum night stay 
somewhere on the page and also create a popup window for the check availability calender. 

I've added pictures with descriptions. 
Please see the links below for references, review the images, 
and contact me with any questions.
