88 - FSH Pricing and Terms: Alternate Nightly Pricing

We need to update Alternate Nightly Pricing 
section to include weekly and monthly pricing 
in addition to the fields that we already have. 

I've included examples below of flipkey's design. 
I really like how they display their information.   

The design should contain the following: 

Check in, 
Check out, 
Minimum Night Stay, 
Price Per Night, 
Weekend Per Night, 
Weekly Price, 
Monthly Price

Did not see the Check in / Check out in our 
great new design.

Would it be appropriate to place Check in / Check out 
with Basic pricing? These would most likely 
not be changing with our different rate schemes. 

We have built a complete module for Alternate Minimum Night Stay 
so that users may elect to create Alternate Minimum Night Stays 
weather they have created Alternate Pricing or not. 

Other than that, this looks very straightforward.
