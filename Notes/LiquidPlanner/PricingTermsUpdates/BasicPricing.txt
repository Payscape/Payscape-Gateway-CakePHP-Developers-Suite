
88 - FSH Pricing and Terms: Basic Pricing

We need to add the fields Currency, 
Price per week, and Price per month to our 
basic pricing section on the dashboard. 

I've added links below of flipkey and AirBnB's design. 
I really like how descriptive flipkey and the 
questions they ask, as well as their layout. 

For the currency, the default currency should 
be at "US Dollar." We want to design functionality 
for future global currencies, however guests 
will only be able to choose US Dollars until 
we launch our payment system. 

Minimum Night stay should be displayed in 
this section as well.

	properties_currencies 
		this will hold the country id for the currency, 
		which can then be pulled out of the coutries table
	
	was thinking of using properties.country_id
	but that is for the property country, 
	not the currency country.
	
	WAS also thinking of using countries table, 
	but we need to be able to control which 
	currencies are active.  
	
	for our currencies drop down we want a table 
	currencies:
	
	SELECT INTO currencies(country_id, country_name, currency_name) FROM (SELECT countries.country_id, 
	countries.name, countries.currencyName 
	FROM countries ORDER BY countries.id)
	
	UPDATE currencies SET active = 1
	WHERE country_id = US
