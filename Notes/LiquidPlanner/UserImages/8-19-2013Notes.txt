
	we need Acl Extras running so that we can grant permissions for our new controllers functions. 
	
	cake -app "C:\xampp-vfish-git\xampp\htdocs\fishbake.localdomain\cake2.2.2\app" acl_extras -h
	
	We need a new structure for User images
		img/users/$user_id/
		
		
		
		
currently the system creates three different images for every user. 
we want multiple user images so we need a new scheme for these. 

we'll use property images as a model for this. 

Model
	UserImages
Controller 
	UserimagesController
View
	UserImages
	
	new actions for Acl
	
	user_images
		add
		edit
		remove
		upload
