
So that we don't disrupt opertaions, 
copy users table to the Fishbake db. 
but use paths that will place our new images where they belong. 

this way we can play with the Users but not screw up stuff in the main 
database. 

so change the db connection in Fishbake to use the vacahom_fishbake db
on dev and production servers, and fishbake here on local developemnt.
