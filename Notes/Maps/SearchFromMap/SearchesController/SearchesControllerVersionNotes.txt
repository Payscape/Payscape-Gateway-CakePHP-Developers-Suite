the latest version 7/05/2013 is our working version. 

07 and 08 are attempts at getting the search in map functions 
working better, but none of them are able to produce 
updated paginated results. 

instead, when we click on the paginated results 
we are taken back to the original search before 
any map results were delivered. 

Rx
	Ajax needs to send pagination results for the 
	updated map search. 
	
	could be there are conflicting functions. 
	
	looks like working in results.js might give us pagination 
	results to match our map search results. 
	
	check out the JSON response when we are searching from map.
