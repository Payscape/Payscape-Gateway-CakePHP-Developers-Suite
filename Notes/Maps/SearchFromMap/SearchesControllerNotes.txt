ajax_results
	we do not pass a destination to this query, instead we pass 
	our lat lng coordinates, and our criteria. 
	use the apps we just completed so that we can pass this stuff in a 
	single post, 
	and then build the method on the controller so that he sends back 
	the data in jkHXC (or whatever that variable is called). 
	
	this isn't rocket science, well actually it is. 
	
	

Currently our Searches Controller is trying to 
use the bounds of the map to perform searches. 

Instead, we need to 
1 retrieve the center of the map long / lat
2 if(redo search has been clicked)

	send the longitude and latitude to Searches / results
	get the ids for the properties that match those long / lat first, 
	
	then add this to the regular query 
	
	if($longitute && $latitude){ // this is a map search 
	
		$conditions .= "AND id IN($long_lat_ids);
		
		'id IN' => $long_lat_ids,
		
		
		$this->Word->find('all', array(
    'conditions' => array(
    'Property.id' => $long_lat_ids,
    )
));
		
		
we actually may want to simply build a new search function 
just like we did for save_search and use it instead. 
trying to pile all of this into Searches / results 
hold on: we do need to use this method because we aren't
no, not so. We can JSON back from any controller or method, 
so let's explore creating our own ajax_get_results 
and use it for our map queries. 

where is the JSON being created for Searches / results?
we can use that for the patterns we want to be returning.
