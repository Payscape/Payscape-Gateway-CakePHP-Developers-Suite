We can save our updated db to disk, 
but looks like it's getting a little large 
to use phpMyAdmin to restore, so let's use 
mysql to rebuilt the DBs. 

This did the trick and solved the problem we were 
having with the Validate Address widget. 
Apparently something was happening when importing via phpMyAdmin, 
using the command line is actually much quicker.
