To test, I created a new file and then locked it. I then entered your command and received the same message you received. So it seems your guess about the file being locked is correct.

You can try to unlock the file using Finder:

1) In the Finder Go menu, choose Go to Folder.

2) Type in the path to the folder that contains the file, and then click Go.

3) In the window that opens, select the file and then select Get Info from the Finder File menu.

4) In the panel that opens, uncheck the Locked box in the General section of the panel.

(This can also be accomplished from Terminal using the SetFile command, but unless you've installed the Developer Tools, I don't think you have this command on your system.)
