$data['pussy'] = 'wagon';
That's all you need to add the key and value to the array.

so that we may have dynamic submissions, get the posted data, 
then append the fixed variables afterward. 

	$data = $_POST;
	$data = $this->request->data;
	
	$data['username'] = $username;
	$data['password'] = $password;
