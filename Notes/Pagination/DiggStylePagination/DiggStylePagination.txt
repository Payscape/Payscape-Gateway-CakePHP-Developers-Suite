put PaginationHelper.php in View/Helper

in the Controller

As with all helpers, you have to tell Cake to include it before 
it becomes available. Therefore, open up the controller you want 
it to use it in (or your app_controller.php if you'd like it available 
to every controller), and add it to the $helpers array property.



Another thing to note is that this helper extends the functionality 
of the default HtmlHelper, so you have to make sure to include it 
in the $helpers array as well.

===================
Controller Class:
===================

<?php  

class EntriesController extends AppController 
{ 

    var $helpers = array( 'Html', 'Pagination' ); 

    function index($page=1) 
    { 
        // blah blah blah 

        $this->set( 'pag_link', '/entries/view/' ); 
        $this->set( 'pag_page', $page ); 
        $this->set( 'pag_total', $this->Entry->findCount() ); 
    } 

} 

?>


Get It Working in the View

Now the only thing left to do is to call it in the view. 
As you can see from the example controller above, we made an 
index method that sets some variables to be available in that 
method's associated view file. 

We will use this information when making the call to our 
Pagination helper, as shown below.



View Template:

<h2>Additional Pages</h2> 

<?php $pagination->$paginate($pag_link, $pag_page, $pag_total); ?> 


That's pretty much all there is to it. You can also supply the 
last two parameters if you'd like, 
so that you can change the amount of "number links" in-between the 
first and last numbers, or the text to be printed in the "skips" 

(what exactly these things are will become apparent when using the helper).


I'm sure there might be a better way to do this, so if you have any suggestions, comments are always welcome.
