##Documentation##
All of the primary function for the BillingOrchard.com API are included in this wrapper. 
Full field definitions can be found at http://billingorchard.com/api_documentation.cfm. 
Field naming conventions and required fields are included inside each of the Add functions. 
All data is returned from BillingOrchard's API as a JSON string and is converted to an Array that can then be parsed by the controller. 
The following convention is universal to all available functions. 

Example Add Client:
```
$client = array(
	'ClientLogin' => 'ClientLoginName',
	'ClientPassword' => 'Password',
	'Client' => 'Actual Client Name',
	'Email' => 'full@emailaddress.com'
);
$this->BillingOrchard->AddClients($client);
```
Example Edit Client:
```
$client = array(
	'ClientID' => 7893 //Sample,
	'Tel' => '777-777-7777',
	'Address' => '123 Address Street',
	'Address2' => 'APT 123',
	'City' => 'GreatCity',
	'State' => 'GA'
);
$this->BillingOrchard->EditClients($client);
```
Example View Client:
```
$this->BillingOrchard->ViewClients(7893); //ID is optional
```
Example Delete Client:
```
$this->BillingOrchard->DeleteClients(7893); //ID is required
```
