Overview:
	We want to build a class that can interface with the Payscape API, and return the resulting data via cURL. 
	All data is returned from the Payscape API as a cURL string and is converted to an Array that can then be parsed by the controller.
	
	
	In our BillingOrchard class we see typical transactions that are sent to the BillingOrchard API, and then return data via JSON.
