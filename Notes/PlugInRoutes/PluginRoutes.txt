    although we have a Controller FileUpload, 
    he can't use any params. so... 
    
    we created ImageUploadController, 
    file_upload/    // our Plugin Name (FileUpload)
    image_upload/  // our Controller Name ImageUpload
    index/                        // now our three params
    3/4/5
