 holiday_price
 weekday_price
 
 so we need functions to check to see if a given date 
 falls on a weekend or a holiday.
 
 so in our calc_price we have a loop that is simulating our days, 
 but they are in Unix timestamps, so we need to 
 	1 convert them $dateval = date('Y-m-d', $day); // $day is in unix timestamp
 	
 	$md = date('Y-m-d', $check_date);
 	
 	
 	this should work because we do not need hours or seconds. 
 	
 	came up with something better. 
 	calculate the days between startdate and enddate
 	
 	convert startdate and enddate to unix timestamp, 
 	create the array of dates, converting them to date('Y-m-d')
 	so that we can simply is if(in_array($holidays)) to check 
 	if a given date falls on any of the User's holidays.
 	
	public_html/webroot/datelab has a simple page that tests 
	to and from unix timestamp, and checks a simple array of holidays 
	and has a weekend check as well. Completed testing for Total Rate 
	to calculate Total Rate, Avg per night, and Total Nights. 
	we need to use < enddate because travelers do not pay for the night 
	of checkout.
