USER CREATES HER OWN HOLIDAYS
-------------------------------
1 provide a date picker process so that user may create 
her own list of holidays. 

Step One: how many holiday selections would you like?

drop down menu 1 to 20

for $i = 1 to $dropdowns{
	// display a datepicker input named 
		Rates.holidays.holiday
}

when these are submitted
	$holidays = array($this->request['holidays']);
	$userid = $this->User->user_id;
	
	if(empty($holidays)){
		$holidays = array();
	}
	
	$Holiday.holidays = serialize($holidays);
	$Holiday.user_id = $user_id
	
Now each user may save her own holidays. 
personalized. 
to create a new set: 
start over. 

/or/ 
bring out the array of datepickers again, 
unserialize the holidays, put them into their own text boxes,
offer the date pickers, and onchange(#datapicker<?php echo $i; ?>).
	// just make sure that if a date picker is used on an existing 
	date that it replaces it rather than concantenates it. 
	
	with all that screwing around, seems like it would be simpler 
	to have a clean set, with perhaps the option to drag them 
	from a list onto each holiday input. 
	
	then datepicker can be used on one that is goofed up. 
	
	also, ? # of dates?
	
	if there is an existing record, bring them all out, 
	if the number requested is more than those in the mix, 
	add them at the end.
	
---------------------------------------------------------------
THEN IN HER PROPERTIES HER HOLIDAYS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE USED
---------------------------------------------------------------
	Calculate according to 
		$holidays = Yow! Store these right in the user table, 
		in a serialized field called holidays. 
		
		this will make them readily available 
		
		this way, if a user manages properties in Malaysia, 
		Ireland, Canada and the US, she can simply create an 
		account for each locale (does that really make sense?)
		
		when creating holidays, had a set that are ready to go, 
		such as July 4, December 25, December 31, with their names 
		next to each. these can prepopulate that array of inputs
		when the date picker is used, assign the value to a div
		rather than an input box, like we did on CCS.
