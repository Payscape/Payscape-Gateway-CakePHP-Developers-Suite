
Some generic ways are:
1.
array ('action' = '/myFunction/'. $id .'/'.$another_id); 

2.
$Html-> link ('edit', array ('url'='/ myController/myFunction? Id ='. $Id. '& another_id ='. $another_id)). 

3.
$Html-> link ('edit', array ('action' = 'myFunction', $id,$another_id)). 

The function in myController would look like:
 function myFunction ($id, $another_id){
   // do something
}

we want method 2 so that we can build out our stuff. 
using jQuery to build our link with the data in it. 

we shall see. 

how about this. 

	onClick fires the ajax to go ahead and save the search. 
	by the time the window opens ... oops. 
	no way to know unless we just query for the most recent 
	saved search for the user, which does make sense. 
	
	this way everything is done, and we can actually create 
	a name for the search. Stephen 5/13/2013 2:15 PM
	
	my search #1
	this way, if the user does not rename the search, 
	it's still usable. 
	
	and they don't have to bother with a name for it. 
	then user can click the search pop,
