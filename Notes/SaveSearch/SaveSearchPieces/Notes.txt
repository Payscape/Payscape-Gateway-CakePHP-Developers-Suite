OK, we can read the sliders, but not 
the Amenities check boxes

why is this?
they are getting sent in the same post. 




searches/save_search (
should have been called saved searches?

this function may actually do both. 
get the saved searches as well as "save" 
the saved searches. let's look. 



OK, look at it this way. 
Our Create a Saved Search page does in fact save the search. 
investigate how this page works, 
and you should have searchpop code that 
is necessary. 

then :: 
	use what you find for search pop, 
	
	and use the sliders code from search results
	to put into save search page
	
these two things should get this straightened out for you. 

==========================
we want the entire string of data that is getting 
sent to ajax_load_search

is there a way to read ajax_load_search?



replaced save_search.ctp with the previous version, 
this fixed. now we just need to get the sliders working 
in the Create a new Search form. 

and get the Searches/popup form working. 

searches/popup - how to get the search data 
out of searches/results 

this would be the trick. 

 
http://localhost:8082/vfish22.localdomain/public_html/search/popup





we are seeing a jQuery error re: validationEngine. 
this could indicate that our problems are in some JS files. 

results.js is loaded, may well be in here. 
we want to be able to load Searches/popup, 
and have that form's SaveSearch field populated with the 
search data so that it can be serialized and saved to the 
search form. 

results.js are the same on Six and Ten/xampp
results.js are the same on Ten/xampp and Ten/xampp1.7.2

so our problems are not in here. 
must be in saved_search.ctp




app-xampp
----------
4/01, xampp/.. vacationfish.localdomain

app-xampp1.7.2
---------------
5/01, xampp1.7.2 vfish22.localdomain

app-six
--------
These files were worked on 3/18 to 3/26
from Six. 

That version the Create Saved Search page works, 
all except for the sliders. 

It could be that that sliders code is goofed up on our 
current version, which is stopping the page from functioning 
correctly. 

might be easiest to just get back to where we were then, 
while at the same time saving that latest work into files. 
(controller. view) these are about the only files involved in 
this. 

1 compare the two controllers
2 compare the two views
