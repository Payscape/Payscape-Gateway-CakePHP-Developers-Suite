
The search comes in through the url
1 is this smart?
is there another way to do this?

Can thickbox open before: ho ho. 
put an onclick function in the hyperlink that opens 
the window. fire an ajax call with the data in it. 
but this does open vulnerabiities. 

can we initiate an ajax query to the user's page?

no, there is no state. 


send it in an ajax post and access it with Cake in 

	if($this->request(isAjax){
		
			$our_pie = $this->data
			
			most likely we have this already in the 
			existing save search, so next all we have to do
			is get the correct params from search popup
			then fire those at the existing save_search. 
			
			that thing is most likely set up to save whatever 
			params are sent as key value pairs 
			
			next up: pass an array in a link element 
	
	}
	
	
no, we need to get to the pop up page, so we'll ride a hyperlink with a bunch of stuff in it. 

now, just what can we pass as variables like this?
