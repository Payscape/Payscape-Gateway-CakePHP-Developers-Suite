
	Serialize saves an array as a string into a text (blob) field. 
	these are useful because we do not have to store those values in rows, columns in tables, 
	but instead just cram them into a single text field. 
	
	$ar1 = array (
		'pet1' => 'cat',
		'pet2' => 'dog',
		'pet3' => 'goldfish',
	);
	
	$ser = serialize($ar1);
