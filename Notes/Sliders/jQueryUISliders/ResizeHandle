Slider in UI - how to set handle size? Answered
in Using jQuery UI  •  3 years ago  
I am using the Slider part of the jQuery UI and I'd like to know if there is a way of resizing the handle to a set size? 
 
The jQuery documentation indicates that 'ui-slider-handle' is the CSS class name that should be used to tweak the handle.

However, I have tried to make the handle a fixed size (e.g. 30px wide) using this class but tweaking the CSS seems to have no effect - looking in the JS it seems there is some calculation to produce the handle size and that the handle size is dynamic (based on slider pane contents) - is this the case?

Is there a way to keep the slider working the same way but have a set handle size?

I assume you tried
Copy code
.ui-slider-handle { width: 30px; }

and didn't have any luck because of css specificity. The rule in the slider css is more specific so it wins. You can override it with the same specificity
Copy code
.ui-slider .ui-slider-handle { width: 30px; }

Note also that a slider handle's position is related to its width. A slider handle by default has a width of 1.2em and to center the handle over its position (rather than left-aligning it) it's given a negative left margin of 1/2 that, or -0.6em; So if you want a width of 30px:
Copy code
.ui-slider .ui-slider-handle { width: 30px; margin-left: -15px; }

You're example is exactly how I want it - however, using the CSS you have provided doesn't solve the issue for me. There must be some other style overiding it.

I am using the 'dark hive' jQuery UI theme which I am amending to my needs. In the jquery-ui-1.8rc3.custom.css style sheet the only rules relating to 'slider' are:

Copy code
/* Slider*/
----------------------------------
.ui-slider { position: relative; text-align: left; }
.ui-slider .ui-slider-handle { position: absolute; z-index: 2; height: 8px; cursor: default; }
.ui-slider .ui-slider-range { position: absolute; z-index: 1; font-size: .7em; display: block; border: 0; background-position: 0 0; }

I then have some other rules in my main style sheet relating to the slider. These are:

Copy code
/* Slide Section: START */

#who-frame >div.who { padding: 10px !important; }
        .scroll-pane { overflow: auto; width: 99%; float:left; }
        .scroll-content { width: 1464px; float: left; }
        .scroll-content-item { width: 100px; height: 100px; float: left; margin: 10px; font-size: 3em; line-height: 96px; text-align: center; }
        * html .scroll-content-item { display: inline; } /* IE6 float double margin bug */
        .scroll-bar-wrap { clear: left; padding: 0 4px 0 2px; margin: 0 -1px -1px -1px; }
        .scroll-bar-wrap .ui-slider { padding-top: 1px; margin-left: auto; margin-bottom: 0; margin-right: auto; margin-top: -20px; background: none; border:0; height: 16px;  }
        .scroll-bar-wrap .ui-handle-helper-parent { position: relative; height: 100%; margin: 0 auto; }
        .scroll-bar-wrap .ui-slider-handle { top:.2em; height: 1.5em; }
        .scroll-bar-wrap .ui-slider-handle .ui-icon { margin: -8px auto 0; position: relative; top: 50%; }
        .ui-slider .ui-slider-handle { width: 30px; margin-left: -15px; }
        
/* Slide Section: END */

As you can see I have added the rule you suggested but the handle remains the same size. Perhaps you would be so kind as to point out my error?

Thanks in advance.

Can't see anything from here. Can you create a minimal example on jsbin.com? You can reference the dark-hive theme with http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css

Hi, thanks for taking a look at this. I just uploaded an example on my own server. I've included the graphics used in my slider just in case there is something relevant there.

[test page removed now problem fixed]

Sure it's something simple but I can't for the life of me see it!

This also shows the problem I'm having with the text below not being hidden when scrolling along but that's another problem entirely!

For the problem below the slider:
Try setting a height: 170px on the .scroll-pane div so it's high enough to fit both top and bottom part of content and remove position: absolute from the .porttext

Seemed to do the trick in ff anyways... :)

slide.js is setting the width all over the place, right on the the element

Thanks gentleman, all sorted now. 

@ Robert, that was it! I just edited out the '//size scrollbar and handle proportionally' part of the slide.js and the handle is behaving as desired. Thanks for that.

@ Balázs - great stuff, thanks for replying. Was tearing my (admittedly not much left) hair out!

@ benfrain.com 

I've the same problem! i didn't see the @ Robert answer..

I have the same script with the '//size scrollbar and handle proportionally' .. what should i need to change?
I want the handle will have smaller width (something like half of the current width)

Thanks!

 $(document).ready(function(){

 $('.ui-slider-handle').height(50)  

})
