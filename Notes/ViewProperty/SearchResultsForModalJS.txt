We have to set up the Modal in Search Element


now to find the correct element for the search results page, 
then add this to the hyperlinks on the page: 

'class' => 'viewbox', 


    View/Elements/search_page_list.ctp
    here we add the class "viewbox" to the image and main hyperlinks. 
    
    View/Searches/results.ctp we add our jquery-colorbox.js script and document ready


<!-- bof: modal window for View -->
<?php $this->Html->script('jquery-colorbox.js', array('inline' => false));?>

<?php $this->Html->scriptblock('
// for view in colorbox
$(document).ready(function(){
           
            $(".viewbox").colorbox({innerWidth:1000, innerHeight:600, iframe:true});       
        }); 
?>
<!-- eof: modal window for View -->



<script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function(){
            $(".viewbox").colorbox({innerWidth:1000, innerHeight:480, iframe:true});
        });
</script>


now that we have jquery-colorbox.js loaded, and this document ready()
all we need to do is apply the class="viewbox" to any hyperlinks we want to use.

Views/Elements/prop_list_elem.ctp   

* THIS DID NOT WORK AS EXPECTED * 
We had an earlier version of jquery-colorbox.js
this loaded the modal window, but we could not control the size 
of the iframe

then we went to a later version, the iframe loaded above 
the page calling it, 

ultimately had to give up on this. 
when the iframe was closed, the Search Results page 
reverted back to the first page.
