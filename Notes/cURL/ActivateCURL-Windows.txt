Windows

Activation of PHP/CURL on windows is starting up notepad (or similar) 
and removing a semicolon from the following line in php.ini:

;extension=php_curl.dll
(Mentioned here: php.net/manual/install.windows.extensions.php)

libcurl is statically linked in, but the SSL libraries are not, 
thus the note to Win32 users on php.net/curl. 
The two SSL-related DLLs from the OpenSSL project (libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll) 
are bundled with the Windows PHP package.

In order to SSL-based protocols (such as HTTPS and FTPS) in your Windows environment, 
you must copy libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll from the DLL folder of the 
PHP/ binary package to the SYSTEM folder of your Windows machine. 
(Ex: C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM).
