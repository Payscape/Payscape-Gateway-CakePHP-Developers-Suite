The .first() method was added in jQuery 1.4.

The :first selector has been around since 1.0.

From the docs:

:first

The :first pseudo-class is equivalent to :eq(0). It could also be written as :lt(1). While this matches only a single element, :first-child can match more than one: One for each parent.

.first()

Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .first() method constructs a new jQuery object from the first matching element.

It seems that .first() is a filter that returns another jQuery object, while :first is just a selector.

But, they can both be used to accomplish the same thing.

So, when should one be used instead of the other? Performance? Please provide examples.
