echo $this->Html->script('jquery-1.7.2.min');

do not include the js, Cake is already going 
to put that in. 

something is conflicting with our sort divs, 
they were working previously, 
but not sure if it is because of the new 
jQuery uploader. 

shouuld be easy enough to test. 
load the create_photos.ctp that we have 
previously, 
/or/ load the default layout
which may be the problem as well.
