
IT looks like the module is configured in 
create_two.js
propertyimages.js

Thanks to Komodo Edit we did a search and it appears those are the two 
files that have the limitations for the number of files. 

Next up: we want a button to search for images to upload, 
then a button to Send the images so that the user 
may initialize what the want to upload rather than having 
the thing start firing as soon as images are placed in the upload queue. 

This should work like a mini FTP engine that is easy to use.
