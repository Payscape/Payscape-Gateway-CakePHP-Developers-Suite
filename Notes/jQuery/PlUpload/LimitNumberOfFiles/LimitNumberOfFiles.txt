
uploader is the queue

hide the submit button until a certain number of files 
have been added. 

uploader.bind('UploadProgress', function() {
   if(uploader.total.uploaded == uploader.files.length) {
      $('#submit').css({'display':'block'});
   }
});

if we have a ready function, 
$('#submit-files-queue').css({'display':'none'});

uploader.bind('UploadProgress', function() {
   if(uploader.total.uploaded == uploader.files.length) {
      $('#submit-files-queue').css({'display':'block'});
   }
});

// we need to check file size as each of them are placed in the queue. 
there may already be a function written for this but we don't recall 
seeing this. 

for now though we may just limit our activity to getting what 
was requested completed. 



 //   get the number of files placed in the queue
    
    var quesize = uploader.files.length
    
// limit MB of combined file sizes

/* Check the queue after files added to see if the total size of all files combined exceeds allowed limit. */

var maxQueueSize = 681574400; // Size in bytes. This is set to 650MB.
uploader.bind('QueueChanged', function(up) {
   if(uploader.total.size > maxQueueSize) {
      alert("Total size of all files exceeds disc capacity! Remove some files!");
   }
});    


// this is for waiting until the correct number of files have been added, 
we can use something like this so that the submit button doesn't 
display until files have been added, plus wait until the submit 
button has been clicked to process them. In the meantime they will 
get uploaded to the temp folder. 

? what happens if they place files in the queue and don't complete 
their action? are those files still placed in the temp folder? 

this may be another reason to process the queue after the first file has 
been uploaded. 

Also, we should have a list getting printer, perhaps to the right of 
the queue like we see in the Custom Uploader demo. 

/* Hide the form submit button until all files have been uploaded to the server. */
uploader.bind('UploadProgress', function() {
   if(uploader.total.uploaded == uploader.files.length) {
      $('#submit').css({'display':'block'});
   }
});

/* Check to see if the upload queue exceeds disc capacity based on disc type. */
var maxCDSize = 681574400;
var maxDVDSize = 5046586572;
uploader.bind('QueueChanged', function(up) {
   if(uploader.total.size > maxCDSize && disc == 'CD') {
      $(".plupload_start").addClass("plupload_disabled");
      alert("Total size of all files exceeds disc capacity!\nPlease remove some files or change disc type to DVD.");
   }
   if(uploader.total.size > maxCDSize && disc == 'DVD') {
      $(".plupload_start").addClass("plupload_disabled");
      alert("Total size of all files exceeds disc capacity!\nPlease remove some files.");
   }
});

// to remove the first file: 

uploader.removeFile(uploader.files[0]);

// to get the queue size
    uploader.total.size.
