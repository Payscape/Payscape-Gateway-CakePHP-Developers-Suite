
	add the styles you want in your css, e.g. style.css
	
	.modal invitation{
	width:800px;
	height:800px; 
	background-color:#00ff00;
}

actually, this isn't quite true. 
don't put any div to contain your modal form, 
then just stuff your contents into the page. 

for some reason this was not working properly, 
but there may have been an unclosed div in the view. 

But we have these:
Properties / contact_me

Searches / popup
Searches / signup_invitation

and so on. none of these have specific CSS, 
but the forms fit nicely into the pages.

MODAL PARTS 

Scripts to load: 
<SCRIPT src="black_files/jquery.colorbox.js"></SCRIPT>
<script>
        $(document).ready(function(){
            //Examples of how to assign the ColorBox event to elements
            $(".contact").colorbox({innerWidth:1000, innerHeight:480, iframe:true});       
        });
<script>
The hyperlink: 
P><A class=contact href="http://localhost:8080/cb/black/contact.html">Contact Us</A></P>





===============================
since View Properties appears to be Ajax driven, 
let's present the page in a Modal diologue, that should do the trick 
so that the user 

http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/

In the head we use this 

  <script>
  $(function() {
    $( "#dialog" ).dialog();
  });
  </script>
  
  
  then in the Properites controller we use this
  
  ========== load new page in modal window ==========
  
  $('#dialog').load('/path/to/aspx', function() {
    $(this).dialog({
        modal: true,
        height: 200
    });
});

include the following JS in HTML

<link href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/themes/base/jquery-ui.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
  
  
  ==========
  
  here is how we call the ctp file without a layout 
  so that the View Properties page can fit inside the Modal
  
  in the Search page is where we need to make the Modal call. 
  let's investigate how to do so. 
  
  class UsersController... {
   function shoppingCart(){
   //doing some stuff...
   $this->layout=null;
   //here you could use $this->render(); but it's not necessary
   }
   
   
   
}// end Users Controller
