Not sure if this works. 
we did find a CakePHP plugin that we are using. 
have successfully gotten it to upload images. 



First of all place all necessary js and css file in webroot directory. 

Place them wherever you need like place js file inside 
webroot/js/jquery_file_upload/ and css inside 
webroot/css/jquery_file_upload. 

Now make one vendor directory called UploadHandler. Inside this 
directory copy paste UploadHandler.php. 

instead of Vendor, we just do this:
                    /*
                 * bof: new uploader
                */
                
                $this->layout = "ajax_create_properties";
                require_once(APP . 'Vendor' . DS. 'UploadHandler/UploadHandler.php');
                
                
                /*
                 * eof: new uploader
                */


Now you almost done. 

now follow below steps. 

In view file copy paste example code which you have downloaded from 
here. [this is index.html in the root of the download]


dont forget to give correct path to each js and css files and in 
form make sure name for file input type is files[ ]. 

now created one controller action in which actual magic will 
happen. copy paste following code and define path as your requirement. 





<?php
class ServicePicturesController extends AppController {

    var $name = 'ServicePictures';

    function upload()
    {
        $this->layout = "ajax_create_properties";
                        /*
                 * bof: new uploader
                */
                
                $this->layout = "ajax_create_properties";
                require_once(APP . 'Vendor' . DS. 'UploadHandler/UploadHandler.php');
                
                
                /*
                 * eof: new uploader
                */

        $options = array
        (
            'script_url' => SITE_URL.'service_pictures/upload/',
            'upload_dir' => APP.WEBROOT_DIR.DS.'img'.DS.'offer_picture'.DS,
            'upload_url' => SITE_URL.'img/offer_picture/',
            'max_number_of_files' => 3,
            'thumbnail' => array
            (
                'max_width' => 150,
                'max_height' => 150
            )
        );

        $upload_handler = new UploadHandler($options, $initialize = false);
        switch ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'])
        {
            case 'HEAD':
            case 'GET':
                $upload_handler->get();
                break;
            case 'POST':
                $upload_handler->post();
                break;
            case 'DELETE':
                $upload_handler->delete();
                break;
            default:
                header('HTTP/1.0 405 Method Not Allowed');
        }
        exit;
    } ?>
