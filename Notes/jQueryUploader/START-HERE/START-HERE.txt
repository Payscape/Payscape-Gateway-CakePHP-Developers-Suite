

    we need to create a new function on PropertiesController
    
    this action is only for our jQuery uploaders. 
    it does not need to have a view, because noone is 
    going to go look at it, and if they do, 
    they aren't someone who should be there. 
    
    public function upload($property_id){
    
    $options = array()
        // put all of the options for UploadHandler in here. 
        in upload handler don't specify the options, like 
        upload dir. 
        pull the initialize function out of there 
        and put it here
        
        then instantiate the class with 
        
        $upload_handler = new UploadHandler
    
    
    }
