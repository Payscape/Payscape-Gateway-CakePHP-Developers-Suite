
The Delete function that appears 
after the files have uploaded does not work

Rx: see if we can just have it not appear.

We need to redo the files sort in the edit. 
When the plupload files are loaded, neither 
the files sort nor the files upload work, so 
they are definitely conflicting with each other. 

File rename has yet to be completed. 

Database entry has yet to be completed.
